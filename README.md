# surveyor

## Synopsis

Surveyor is a Java web application for presenting online surveys to users and getting metrics based on the responses.

## Motivation

This project is written as a small side-project to offer an simplistic surveying tool for customers. It was meant to be an alternative to limesurvey, which looks to be robust but more than originally needed for my purposes.

## Installation

To install this application, pull the files from git (`C:\git\` is the default), build the project (through Maven's `maven-war-plugin`), then deploy the resultant WAR file to a Wildfly server.

## Tests

Tests are available within Maven through the surefire plugin.

## Contributors

Right now Tom Olson (spelchec) is the only person tinkering with this.
